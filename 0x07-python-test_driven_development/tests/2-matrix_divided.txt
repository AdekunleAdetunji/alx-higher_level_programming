This file contains examples demonstrating the use of matrix_divided() function
in the 2-matrix_divided module
=============================================================================

Usage: In other to use the matrix_divided() function, the function is imported
from the module in the manner below
>>> matrix_divided = __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

case 1:
This case demostrates the correct use of the function
>>> matrix_divided([[2], [2]], 2)
[[1.0], [1.0]]

case 2:
This case demonstrates the various error that is raised when this function is
called wrongly

@TypeError1 arising from the calling of the function with invalid argument type
>>> matrix_divided('a', 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

@TypeError2 arising from passing a list argument but not containing an inner
	    list
>>> matrix_divided(['a', 3], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

@TypeError3 arising from passing a list argument of a list of list but whose
inner list has a type that is not an int/float
>>> matrix_divided([['a', 2], [1, 3]], 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

@TypeError4 arising from passing the matrix_divided "div" parameter a value that
	    is neither of int or float type
>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 'a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: div must be a number

@TypeError5 arising from the passage of empty list to the matrix parameter
>>> matrix_divided([], 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

case 3:
This is the case when the second argument passed to the matrix_divided function
is 0
>>> matrix_divided([[1, 2]], 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

case 4:
This is the case when the matrix is a list of list with the div being a float
>>> matrix_divided([[1, 1, 1]], 3.1)
[[0.32, 0.32, 0.32]]
